Dear Y: 
Hey Beautiful, I just wanted to do something simple to say I love you and to put that smile I love so much back on your face. 
I want everyone to know how much you mean to me. Ever since you have entered my life, I've been flying on Cloud 9 and I have not come down yet.
I tell you this everyday, but you are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out and I see that more clearly with each passing day. 
I love everything about you, about us. You do something to me that no other has, you have made me so happy, the happiest I've ever been. 
You give me the most amazing feelings inside, the feeling of being in love with you.
I still don't know what I did to be so lucky to have you in my life, my dream come true... I am so thankful though. 
In this short time that we've been together, we have grown so much and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. 
I love you, Y, with all my heart and soul, always and forever!
Love always.
